# React To-Do Application

This is a simple To-Do application built using ReactJS with Redux for state management.

## Features

- Add tasks: Users can input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing Enter or clicking the "Add Task" button.
- View tasks: All added tasks are displayed in a list format.
- Delete tasks: Each task has a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.

## Bonus Features (Optional)

- Mark tasks as completed: Users can mark tasks as completed without deleting them.
- Persistent storage: Tasks are saved to local storage, so they are not lost on page reload.
